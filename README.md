# The Impact of Academic Dishonesty at Thomas High School

## Overview
This project was conducted at the behest of the school board upon learning of potential academic dishonesty amoung the 9th grade students at Thomas High School.   This additional analysis aims to assist the board with upholding state testing standards and understand the impact of these student's removal from school and district level analyses that were previously conducted. 

## Results

At the district level, removal of the 9th grade students of Thomas High School has had little overall impact - the average math score dropped district wide by 0.2%, athere was no change to the overall average reading score, and there was a 0.1% drop in the percent passing overall. A student's T-Test of statistical difference could acertian whether these small percent changes are enough to trigger statistical significance, but given the size of the district overall and the small number of 9th graders at Thomas High School, it's unlikely that these differences would meet the threshold for statistical significance.  

The story is much the same at the school level - average math, reading, and overall passing rates for both very less than 1%
