# The Impact of Academic Dishonesty at Thomas High School

## Overview
This ad hoc supplemental analysis project was conducted at the behest of the school board upon learning of potential academic dishonesty amoung the 9th grade students at Thomas High School.   This additional analysis aims to assist the board with upholding state testing standards and understanding the impact of these student's removal from school and district level analyses that were previously conducted. 

## Results

At the district level, removal of the 9th grade students of Thomas High School has had little overall impact - the average math score dropped district wide by 0.2%, athere was no change to the overall average reading score, and there was a 0.1% drop in the percent passing overall. A student's T-Test of statistical difference could acertian whether these small percent changes are enough to trigger statistical significance, but given the size of the district overall and the small number of 9th graders at Thomas High School, it's unlikely that these differences would meet the threshold for statistical significance.  

The story is much the same at the school level - average math, reading, and overall passing rates for both vary less than 1% after the exclusion of Thomas High School 9th graders.  Thomas High School remains the second best overall performer district wide in terms of overall passign rate.  The only change to school metrics by grade is that the grades of the 9th grade students at Thomas High School are now entered as 'NaN', which is code for non-applicable data.   

No other district level analyses run for the previous report (scores by school spending, school size, or school type) were impacted by the deletion of the 9th grade math and reading scores at Thomas High School.  

## Summary

In summary, the only effects of the removal of 9th grade student's math and reading scores at Thoams High School are felt in overall district level and school level testing metrics, and they are minimal at best.  At the district level, the average math score district wide drops by 0.1 % (from 79.0% to 78.9%) with the removal of 9th grade students at Thomas High School.  Similarly, the percent passing math from the district summary drops 0.2% (from 75.0% to 74.8%).  While the average reading score district wide did not change with the removal of 9th grade Thomas High School scores, the percentage passing reading district wide dropped 0.3% (from 86% to 85.7%). As a result, the overall passing rate for the district drops from 65% to 64.9%.  

While there were slight shifts in the Thomas High School math and reading averages, percentage passing these subjects, and the overall passing percentage, they are hardly worth mentioning as they are in the less than 1% range.
